Docker - Deep Dive



CHAPTER 11.1
Installing Docker Compose

In this lesson, we will learn about installing Docker Compose and why we should use it.

Download the latest version of Docker Compose:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Apply executable permissions:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Test Docker Compose:

docker-compose --version


CHAPTER 11.2
Compose Commands

In this lesson, we will start using compose by creating a compose file. Then we will create and manage the services by using the most commonly used commands:

build: Build or rebuild services
bundle: Generate a Docker bundle from the Compose file
config: Validate and view the Compose file
create: Create services
down: Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
events: Receive real time events from containers
exec: Execute a command in a running container
help: Get help on a command
images: List images
kill: Kill containers
logs: View output from containers
pause: Pause services
port: Print the public port for a port binding
ps: List containers
pull: Pull service images
push: Push service images
restart: Restart services
rm: Remove stopped containers
run: Run a one-off command
scale: Set number of containers for a service
start: Start services
stop: Stop services
top: Display the running processes
unpause: Unpause services
up: Create and start containers
version: Show the Docker-Compose version information
Setup your environment:

mkdir -p compose/commands
cd compose/commands
Create a docker-compose file:

vi docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.yml contents:

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - "8080:80"
    volumes:
    - nginx_html:/usr/share/nginx/html/
    links:
    - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
volumes:
  nginx_html: {}
Create a compose service:

docker-compose up -d
List containers created by compose:

docker-compose ps
Stopping a compose service:

docker-compose stop
Starting a compose service:

docker-compose start
Restarting a compose service:

docker-compose restart
Delete a compose service:

docker-compose down

CHAPTER 11.3
Creating a Compose File

In this lesson we will look at the basics of creating a compose file.

Setup your environment:

cd compose
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git weather-app
cd weather-app
git checkout compose
Create a docker-compose.yml file:

vi docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.yml contents:

version: '3'
services:
  weather-app:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - VERSION=v2.0
    ports:
      - "8081:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
Create the compose container:

docker-compose up -d
List compose services:

docker-compose ps
Verify the weather-app is working:

curl http://localhost:8081
Rebuild the image:

docker-compose build
Rebuild the image with no cache:

docker-compose build --no-cache
